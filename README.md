# Etch-a-Sketch

A simple web application that allows users to draw and erase on a grid-like canvas, similar to an Etch-a-Sketch toy.

## Live Demo

You can try the application live by visiting the following URL: [Etch-a-Sketch Live Demo](https://faozio.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

## Description

This web application provides an interactive canvas where users can draw and erase by hovering over the squares on the grid. It supports creating a grid of any size between 1 and 100 squares per side. The application also includes a "Reset Grid" button that allows users to clear the current grid and create a new one with a custom size.

## Features

- Create a grid with a specified number of squares per side.
- Hover over squares to draw or erase.
- Reset the grid and specify a new size.

4. To reset the grid and specify a new size, click the "Reset Grid" button. A prompt will appear asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Enter a number between 1 and 100 and click "OK". The grid will be cleared, and a new grid with the specified size will be created.
